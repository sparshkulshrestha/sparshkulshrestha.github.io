# ABOUT ME

Sparsh Kulshrestha (dotdotslash)
Cybersecurity explorer: Uncovering the hidden landscapes of emerging threats, one pixel, packet, and shadow server at a time. My passion? Web apps, mobile, shadow IT, and CI security. Think of me as your friendly neighborhood threat detective, always on the lookout for the next big "uh-oh."

My research is my currency: Featured in The Hindu, Zee Business, Moneycontrol, ZDnet, The Logical Indian, and more, I share my findings with the world, hoping to spark conversations and empower the community. You can also catch me at conferences like BSides Ahmedabad, Bsides Singapore, and C0c0n, geeking out with fellow security enthusiasts.

What you'll find here:

* Deep dives into the latest threats: No jargon, just clear explanations, and insights you can use.
* Countermeasures that actually work: I don't just point out the bad guys, I show you how to stop them.
* A playground for the curious: Web apps, mobile, shadow IT, and CI â€“ my research lab is open to all things strange and potentially attachable.
* A community voice: My research is yours to explore, share, and build upon. Let's learn together!
* This portfolio is my open invitation to the cybersecurity community. Come join me on this intellectual adventure, where knowledge is our weapon and collaboration our shield.

Ready to dig into the unknown? Let's nerd out!
